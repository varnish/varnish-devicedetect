Serve the different content on the same URL
-------------------------------------------

Here are a few examples on how to serve different content to the client based on device classification.

The tricks involved are:

1. Detect the client (pretty simple, just include devicedetect.vcl and call it)
2. Figure out how to signal the backend what client class this is. This includes for example setting a header, changing a header or even changing the backend request URL.
3. Modify any response from the backend to add missing Vary headers, so Varnish' internal handling of this kicks in.
4. Modify output sent to the client so any caches outside our control don't serve the wrong content.

All this while still making sure that we only get 1 cached object per URL per device class.


Example 1: Send HTTP header to backend
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The basic case is that Varnish adds the X-UA-Device HTTP header on the
backend requests, and the backend mentions in the response Vary header that the
content is dependant on this header.

Everything works out of the box from Varnish' perspective.

.. startsnippet-example1

VCL::

    include "devicedetect.vcl";
    sub vcl_recv {
	call devicedetect;
    }
    # req.http.X-UA-Device is copied by Varnish into bereq.http.X-UA-Device

    # so, this is a bit conterintuitive. The backend creates content based on the normalized User-Agent,
    # but we use Vary on X-UA-Device so Varnish will use the same cached object for all U-As that map to
    # the same X-UA-Device.
    # If the backend does not mention in Vary that it has crafted special
    # content based on the User-Agent (==X-UA-Device), add it.
    # If your backend does set Vary: User-Agent, you may have to remove that here.
    sub vcl_backend_response {
        if (bereq.http.X-UA-Device) {
            if (!beresp.http.Vary) { # no Vary at all
                set beresp.http.Vary = "X-UA-Device";
            } elsif (beresp.http.Vary !~ "X-UA-Device") { # add to existing Vary
                set beresp.http.Vary = beresp.http.Vary + ", X-UA-Device";
            }
        }
        # comment this out if you don't want the client to know your classification
        set beresp.http.X-UA-Device = bereq.http.X-UA-Device;
    }

    # to keep any caches in the wild from serving wrong content to client #2 behind them, we need to
    # transform the Vary on the way out.
    sub vcl_deliver {
        if ((req.http.X-UA-Device) && (resp.http.Vary)) {
            set resp.http.Vary = regsub(resp.http.Vary, "X-UA-Device", "User-Agent");
        }
    }

.. endsnippet-example1


Example 2: Normalize the User-Agent string
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Another way of signaling the device type is to override or normalize the
User-Agent header sent to the backend.

For example

    User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; U; Android 2.2; nb-no; HTC Desire Build/FRF91) AppleWebKit/533.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0 Mobile Safari/533.1

becomes:

    User-Agent: mobile-android

when seen by the backend.

This works if you don't need the original header for anything on the backend. A
possible use for this is for CGI scripts where only a small set of predefined
headers are (by default) available for the script.


.. req: txreq -hdr "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; U; Android 2.2; nb-no; HTC Desire Build/FRF91) AppleWebKit/533.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0 Mobile Safari/533.1"
.. req: rxresp
.. req: expect resp.http.X-UA-Device == "mobile-android"
.. req: expect resp.http.Vary == "User-Agent"
.. startsnippet-example2

VCL::

    include "devicedetect.vcl";
    sub vcl_recv {
        call devicedetect;
    }

    # override the header before it is sent to the backend
    sub vcl_backend_fetch { if (bereq.http.X-UA-Device) { set bereq.http.User-Agent = bereq.http.X-UA-Device; } }

    # standard Vary handling code from previous examples.
    sub vcl_backend_response {
        if (bereq.http.X-UA-Device) {
            if (!beresp.http.Vary) { # no Vary at all
                set beresp.http.Vary = "X-UA-Device";
            } elsif (beresp.http.Vary !~ "X-UA-Device") { # add to existing Vary
                set beresp.http.Vary = beresp.http.Vary + ", X-UA-Device";
            }
        }
        set beresp.http.X-UA-Device = bereq.http.X-UA-Device;
    }
    sub vcl_deliver {
        if ((req.http.X-UA-Device) && (resp.http.Vary)) {
            set resp.http.Vary = regsub(resp.http.Vary, "X-UA-Device", "User-Agent");
        }
    }

.. endsnippet-example2

Example 3: Add the device class as a GET query parameter
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

If everything else fails, you can add the device type as a GET argument.

    http://example.com/article/1234.html --> http://example.com/article/1234.html?devicetype=mobile-iphone

The client itself does not see this classification, only the backend request is changed.

.. startsnippet-example3

VCL::

    include "devicedetect.vcl";
    sub vcl_recv {
	call devicedetect;
    }

    # do this after vcl_hash, so all Vary-ants can be purged in one go. (avoid ban()ing)
    sub vcl_backend_fetch {
        if ((bereq.http.X-UA-Device) && (bereq.method == "GET")) {
            # if there are existing GET arguments;
            if (bereq.url ~ "\?") {
                set bereq.http.X-get-devicetype = "&devicetype=" + bereq.http.X-UA-Device;
            } else {
                set bereq.http.X-get-devicetype = "?devicetype=" + bereq.http.X-UA-Device;
            }
            set bereq.url = bereq.url + bereq.http.X-get-devicetype;
            unset bereq.http.X-get-devicetype;
        }
    }

    # Handle redirects, otherwise standard Vary handling code from previous examples.
    sub vcl_backend_response {
        if (bereq.http.X-UA-Device) {
            if (!beresp.http.Vary) { # no Vary at all
                set beresp.http.Vary = "X-UA-Device";
            } elsif (beresp.http.Vary !~ "X-UA-Device") { # add to existing Vary
                set beresp.http.Vary = beresp.http.Vary + ", X-UA-Device";
            }

            # if the backend returns a redirect (think missing trailing slash), we
            # will potentially show the extra address to the client. we don't want that.
            # if the backend reorders the get parameters, you may need to be smarter here. (? and & ordering)
            if (beresp.status == 301 || beresp.status == 302 || beresp.status == 303) {
                set beresp.http.Location = regsub(beresp.http.location, "[?&]devicetype=.*$", "");
            }
        }
        set beresp.http.X-UA-Device = bereq.http.X-UA-Device;
    }
    sub vcl_deliver {
        if ((req.http.X-UA-Device) && (resp.http.Vary)) {
            set resp.http.Vary = regsub(resp.http.Vary, "X-UA-Device", "User-Agent");
        }
    }

Different backend for mobile clients
------------------------------------

If you have a different backend that serves pages for mobile clients, or any
special needs in VCL, you can use the X-UA-Device header like the following.

VCL::

    vcl 4.0;
    include "devicedetect.vcl";

    backend mobile {
        .host = "192.0.2.10";
        .port = "80";
    }

    sub vcl_recv {
        call devicedetect;

        if (req.http.X-UA-Device ~ "^mobile" || req.http.X-UA-device ~ "^tablet") {
            set req.backend_hint = mobile;
        }
    }
    
    sub vcl_hash {
        hash_data(req.url);
        if (req.http.host) {
            hash_data(req.http.host);
        } else {
            hash_data(server.ip);
        }
        if (req.http.X-UA-Device ~ "^mobile" || req.http.X-UA-device ~ "^tablet") {
            hash_data("mobile");
        }
        return (hash);
    }

    sub vcl_hash {
        if (req.http.X-UA-Device ~ "^mobile" || req.http.X-UA-device ~ "^tablet") {
            hash_data(req.http.X-UA-Device);
    }



Redirecting mobile clients
--------------------------

If you want to redirect mobile clients you can use the following snippet.

.. req: txreq -req GET -url /foo -hdr "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; U; Android 2.2; nb-no; HTC Desire Build/FRF91) AppleWebKit/533.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0 Mobile Safari/533.1" -hdr "Host: example.com"
.. req: rxresp
.. req: expect resp.status == 302
.. req: expect resp.http.Location == "http://m.example.com/foo"
.. startsnippet-redir2

VCL::

    include "devicedetect.vcl";
    sub vcl_recv {
        call devicedetect;

        if (req.http.X-UA-Device ~ "^mobile" || req.http.X-UA-device ~ "^tablet") {
            return(synth(750, "Moved Temporarily"));
        }
    }

    sub vcl_synth {
        if (resp.status == 750) {
            set resp.http.Location = "http://m.example.com" + req.url;
            set resp.status = 302;
            return(deliver);
        }
    }

.. endsnippet-redir2


Testing tools
-------------

There are some tools included for testing and validating your setup.

* backend/example-backend.py
* devicedetect-dev.vcl

If you include the -dev.vcl file, you can access /set_ua_device/ to set a
cookie that overrides the value of X-UA-Device which is sent to the backend.
(and used for cache lookups)

Example: enable devicedetection, go to /set_ua_device/mobile-iphone .
Afterwards, access your site as usual. You will now get the content as if your
browser was an iPhone.

There is an example web server in backend/ that listens on port 5911 and replies
differently depending on X-UA-Device. Run it with::

    cd backend
    ./example_backend.py

Now you can access it through::

    http://localhost:5911/devicetest/ , or
    http://localhost:6081/devicetest/ # Change 6081 into your Varnish listening port.

Happy devicedetecting.
